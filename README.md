# Mac "Open in Figma" Shortcut

This tool helps you make tiny helper apps that, when clicked, open a particular file in the Figma Desktop app.

## Why

Figma currently supports opening files from the browser when a Figma link is opened in the browser, but this requires the browser to be briefly brought to the front. This is inconvenient if you're opening the link from anywhere that's not the browser.

## How to use

1. Download or clone this repo.
2. Copy the Figma URL you'd like to make a shortcut to.
3. Open the "Figma Shortcut" app.
4. The app will make a new shortcut named "New Figma Shortcut". Rename and move it wherever you want!

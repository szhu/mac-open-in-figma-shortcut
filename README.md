# Mac "Open in Figma" Shortcut

This tool helps you make shortcut files, when clicked, open a particular file in
the Figma Desktop app.

## Why

You can set the Figma desktop app to open Figma links when they're opened in the
browser. The drawback is that if you open a Figma link from anywhere that's not
the browser, your browser will be brought to the front briefly, and a new tab
will be created.

## How to use

1. Download or clone this repo.
2. Copy the Figma URL you'd like to make a shortcut to; e.g., in a Figma file,
   click Share > Copy link.
3. In Finder, navigate to the folder where you'd like to put the shortcut.
4. From Spotlight or the Dock, open the "Make Figma Shortcut" app.
5. The app will make a new shortcut in the current Finder window.
